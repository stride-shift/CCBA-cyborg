Cyborg Habits: Explain It + Improve It

Day 7: Efficiency Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Plan It + Suggest It

QUOTE #9
================================================================================
Day 3: Priority Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Plan It + Guide It
Role: Exec

"I realised I was prioritising the completion of admin tasks like issuing purchase orders and uploading documents — ticking boxes — without pausing to check important details, like whether the invoice was issued to the correct company. Similarly, I'd assist with travel arrangements; following up on bookings; ordering supplies; etc and move on quickly, not realising that what felt like a small task for me was actually a big help to someone else who was struggling. What made me realise this was a pattern of small issues that created delays, and a colleague's grateful feedback that made me rethink how I value the "invisible" support I offer. Going forward, I'm slowing down just enough to double-check key details and to be more mindful of the real impact my support has — not just on processes, but on people."

Day 3: Priority Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Plan It + Guide It
Role: People Development

"Being able to recognize that you are stuck and simply telling the AI, 'I am stuck, what's next?' can make a massive difference and prevent stagnation/wasting time."

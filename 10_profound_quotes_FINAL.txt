Day 15: Avoidance Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Improve It + Guide It
Role: Development

"The realization that facilitating might not be essential revealed I was avoiding letting go of control, driven by a fear that teams or tools couldn't deliver without my direct guidance. Naming this resistance felt like a mix of relief and unease—relief at seeing the root cause, but unease at admitting I was clinging to perfectionism. Tools like Notion or AI assistants like Fireflies.ai could eliminate 70-80% of facilitation tasks (per 2025 Atlassian data), freeing up time and mental energy. This insight pushed me to rethink workflows and trust systems more, sparking curiosity to test async collaboration in real scenarios."

Day 3: Priority Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Plan It + Guide It
Role: Exec

"I realised I was prioritising the completion of admin tasks like issuing purchase orders and uploading documents — ticking boxes — without pausing to check important details, like whether the invoice was issued to the correct company. Similarly, I’d assist with travel arrangements; following up on bookings; ordering supplies; etc and move on quickly, not realising that what felt like a small task for me was actually a big help to someone else who was struggling. What made me realise this was a pattern of small issues that created delays, and a colleague’s grateful feedback that made me rethink how I value the “invisible” support I offer. Going forward, I’m slowing down just enough to double-check key details and to be more mindful of the real impact my support has — not just on processes, but on people."

Day 4: Decision Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Suggest It + Guide It
Role: Exec

"The safe choice felt like sinking into a “known/familiar/safe” space. The scary/unfamiliar one made my chest tighten and I felt uneasy. Not sure if I was more afraid to look incompetent than to be seen as someone who can step out of her comfort zone. I realised that I’m afraid of failure. That surprised me. I noticed how much I still fear vulnerability. I think that Chat will push me out of my comfort zone, if I’m brave enough to push my limits."

Day 2: Culture Rules Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Imagine It + Critique It
Role: Exec

"The invisible rule I feel exist is that people believe it’s safer to stay quiet than to give honest feedback — even in anonymous surveys. There exists a lack of trust in the system and past experiences where speaking up were traced back to the employee and now it is easier to complete surveys with filtered truths. The problem with this is that critical issues stay hidden, and people disengage because they don’t believe their voices lead to real change.

Try to communicate that surveys will be moved to a new feedback platform (or redesigning our current one) that will not track any identifying information. No IPs, no metadata, no silent tracing. Be clear about what’s collected and what isn’t, to ensure that the feedback received is trustworthy."

Day 9: Feedback Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Guide It + Critique It
Role: Exec

"I’ve realised that how I say something can impact others just as much, if not more, than what I’m trying to say. My intention might be clarity or self-protection, but if my tone feels sharp or dismissive, the other person may feel hurt, rejected, or misunderstood. It’s not just about the message; it’s about the delivery. I’m learning that standing by my decisions doesn't mean I have to push others away in the process. It's possible to be firm and clear without being reactive. I need to learn to pause and ask myself what is really being asked/questioned and how can I respond without creating conflict."

Day 14: Obsolescence Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Imagine It + Suggest It
Role: Exec

"Goodness this will be a new mind frame for me – to automate my repetitive work, wow, wow. I would love to spend my time experimenting with higher level activities, i.e. like spotting patterns; mining insights from data to inform smarter decisions, redesigning team communication for clarity and energy. I think I will then be able to add more value to those around me."

Day 1: Clarity Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Explain It + Improve It
Role: Development

"The biggest surprise in improving how I communicate is how small changes in words or structure can make things clear or confusing, even if the main idea seems simple. I thought being precise and simple was enough, but I learned that understanding the audience's knowledge and expectations is just as important. For example, when I simplified the architecture description, I thought a smart 12-year-old would understand "smart chatbot" easily, but testing showed that terms like "prompt flow" or "managed compute" needed easier words to avoid confusion, even though they seemed clear to me. The difference between what I think is clear and what actually works often comes from assuming others know the same things I do or not using simple, relatable words."

Day 12: Jargon Translation Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Explain It + Plan It
Role: Exec

"I communicated that only a selected few people needed to present the group’s strategies, and while it seemed clear to me at the time, it turned out to be confusing. I had assumed everyone shared the same context, but they didn’t — what made sense in my head wasn’t as obvious to others. This reveals that although I value clarity and focus on outcomes, I’ve unintentionally skipped important steps and under-communicated the process. My effort to simplify was well-intentioned, but in complex projects, more structure is often needed, not less. Going forward, I need to give clearer, more detailed instructions — perhaps using bullet points, examples, and defined expectations to ensure shared understanding."

Day 5: Message Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Explain It + Improve It
Role: Britehouse Mobility

"The emphasis on the critical nature of what we are doing was highlighted to me. I will not change my approach though as it was specified to point, but I may add the insight of importance.

This is a critical moment to establish clear roles and open communication now, because how we set this up will directly impact our control, efficiency, and ability to adapt as we grow—missed details or confusion could lead to costly mistakes later."

Day 8: Bias Detection Challenge
Cyborg Habits: Critique It + Suggest It
Role: Development

"I assumed your team valued daily live facilitation as much as you did, creating blind spots that hid their desire for autonomy and comfort with async tools. This led me to overemphasize your role in my suggestions, missing chances to highlight team-driven wins like faster workflows or higher morale (60% of employees prefer autonomy, per 2025 Gallup). It showed up in my facilitator-centric advice, like focusing on your control fears rather than team readiness for tools like Standuply, which 80% of teams adopt quickly (2025 X posts). Now, I’d start with a team survey to uncover their preferences and frame solutions as empowering them, not just freeing you."

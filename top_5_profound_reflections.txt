The breakthrough won't be the big things on my list - it'll be the small shift I'm ignoring now
Sales|11|Future Planning Challenge|What did you discover today?

We were spot on to realise there is a major difference between being a Thought Leader versus Selling. This needs to be a critical filter in the leads generation process because the response templates are different. For example, where the person asked a question at an event versus someone asking for a system. It is not difficult, but the tone is different. There will be many vendors eventually making use of similar POV technology. This can clutter peoples’ mailboxes even more. The successful ones will be the ones using it wisely and humanize communication and experience.

How did these challenges change your perspective?

Don’t sell directly when the person is asking for advice. Answer the question. When you provide the right answer and solution, the person will ask how much it costs.

What will you do differently going forward?

We will need to engineer our response templates in line with Though Leadership or Selling.
When communicating, ask one clever exciting question to stimulate a response rather to ask for a 15 minute call.


"The breakthrough won't be the big launch - it'll be the small shift I'm ignoring now."

"I can create that 'lucky break' by doing [specific thing] this week."

If my current project (to generate sales by making use of the new leads generation process) succeeds wildly by 2030, what will have been the unexpected turning point that made it all click?

🔄 Unexpected Turning Point: From Outreach to Insight
•	You shifted the entire approach from "reaching out to sell" to "reaching out to understand."
•	Instead of just pitching AMIP or SAP PM improvements, your outreach evolved into a discovery-led approach—asking smart questions, listening carefully, and reflecting insights back to the lead in a way that made them feel seen and understood.
•	This humanized the experience.
•	You moved from being a vendor to being a thought partner.
•	The response rate—and trust—skyrocketed.
________________________________________
🧠 You Turned the POV into a Diagnostic Tool
•	The POV report matured into something akin to a "mini-digital twin audit"—personalized, interactive, and consultative.
•	Decision-makers didn’t just read it—they used it to shape internal conversations and validate their pain points. It made your outreach too useful to ignore.
________________________________________
🌍 You Found the Right Niche Community
•	At some point, you discovered a small but influential digital community or network of senior maintenance/engineering professionals (perhaps on LinkedIn, Reddit, or Slack), and you earned trust there.
•	From that community, your pipeline filled with qualified, eager, referral-rich leads—not because you scaled faster, but because you scaled trust first.
________________________________________
🎯 Precision Targeting Got Truly Personal
•	You didn’t just filter by company and job title—you filtered by career moments (e.g., just promoted, just certified, just joined company X, just posted about SAP struggles).
•	That precision made your message feel right-time, right-place, and created a feeling of synchronicity that generic cold emails never could.
________________________________________
🤖 You Used AI as a Thinking Partner, Not Just a Tool
•	Somewhere along the line, your team began to use AI not just to automate outreach—but to co-create insight, adapt tone to each lead, and identify unseen buying triggers.
•	The personalization didn’t feel robotic. It felt tailored and thoughtful—because it was co-designed with intelligence, not blasted by a robot.
________________________________________
💡 Bottom Line
•	The wild success will come not just from doing more, but from:
•	Slowing down to understand,
•	Focusing on high-trust, high-fit interactions,
•	And turning sales from “contacting leads” into “activating champions.”

Based on that future turning point, what's one small change I could make to my project this week that plants that seed?

🌱 Seed: Add 1 Insightful Question to Every Outreach Email
	Instead of just inviting them to a 15-minute call, ask one thoughtful, non-threatening question that invites reflection and builds trust.
For example:
	“What’s one challenge your team is facing this quarter when it comes to SAP PM data reliability or consistency?”
	Or:
	“Curious—how do you currently prioritize uptime improvements across sites?”
________________________________________
Why it matters:
•	It invites engagement instead of resistance.
•	It positions you as a curious partner, not a pushy vendor.
•	It gives you signal back—real feedback that can guide better follow-ups, POV tailoring, and content creation.
•	It shifts the tone from “transaction” to “conversation.”|2025-07-28

Day: 6 - Opposite Strategy Challenge
Role: Pragma
Date: 2025-07-22
Profundity Score: 57.0

I realized that my current approach might be missing foresight, depth and certain considerations. It also gave me a test if the opposite perspective could have as much of an impact as my original perspective. or whether my pesrspective is even necessary to begin with.
Pragma|6|Opposite Strategy Challenge|I used the "opposite approach" idea here: "What would happen if my team and I took the completely opposite approach to going from brain storming solutions to problems, to identifying the best solutions? What would we discover about what we're currently missing?"

Our current approach is potentially setting us up to spend a lot of time discussing and iterating on potential solutions that have little value, while we miss the high value options. It's also exposing blind spots like not looking at solving one of the 11 pain points at all. And a lot of other insights...

I'm pretty concerned my team is heading in the wrong direction and I'm not entirely sure what to do about it.... The response to this says it all: "Translate our current approach and this opposite approach into what a customer would actually experience. What story does each tell?"

Story 1 – “Feature-First” (your current flow)
Lois opens her timesheet on Monday and finds a gleaming new Smart Assistant pane with auto-captured calendar blocks, colourful streak badges, and a “Copy Last Week” button. She’s intrigued, but after ten minutes she still can’t decide which of the 160 project codes fits her design review, and the Assistant’s guess is wrong. Finance loves the new dashboards, yet Lois wonders why she spent extra time fixing descriptions for warnings that don’t seem to matter. The experience feels like lots of shiny add-ons piled onto the old maze—helpful in places, but the core friction (finding the right code and knowing why it matters) lingers in the background.

Story 2 – “Problem-First” (the opposite flow)
Before any new widgets appear, Lois notices that half the rarely used codes have vanished and her role now shows just 25 favourites. An inline counter tells her she’s under five minutes—down from fifteen—to finish the sheet. Two weeks later a slim auto-capture pilot offers to pre-fill only meetings over one hour; she clicks Accept and edits two entries. On Friday a concise “Time Story” email lands in her inbox, highlighting that her focus hours beat the design-team average and saved the project three review cycles. Each change is small but laser-targeted: the clutter shrinks first, quick wins build trust, and every new feature is visibly tied to a metric she cares about—so the journey feels lighter, purposeful, and steadily better week after week.|2025-07-23
d-lab|6|Opposite Strategy Challenge|Today I discovered the power of intentionally flipping my perspective. By exploring the opposite of what I'd normally do, I was forced to confront assumptions I didn't even realize I was making. It made me see that my current approach, while thoughtful, might be too cautious, too focused on getting things right instead of getting them moving.

This challenge reminded me that clarity doesn't always come from refining the same idea, sometimes it comes from breaking it entirely. Going forward, I will include an opposite approach when problem solving.|2025-07-23
d-lab|6|Opposite Strategy Challenge|I realised that my current approach to student check-ins, where I follow up consistently and ask for detailed updates, might actually be creating a sense of surveillance rather than support. While I intend to be helpful and attentive, it might come across as micromanaging or distrustful.

When I imagined the opposite, less frequent, more open-ended check-ins where students are trusted to reach out when they need help, I saw that this could build a sense of ownership, confidence, and accountability. It flips the story from “We’re watching you” to “We trust you.”

Flipping my perspective showed me that less control might create more growth. I’d never considered that before because I assumed involvement = support. But now I’m thinking, maybe empowerment is the most powerful form of care.|2025-07-24

Day: 15 - Avoidance Challenge
Role: Pragma
Date: 2025-08-04
Profundity Score: 52.0

I discovered that I did not know how to start the project. It feels ok to name the resistance but better to know where I can start since I dig a bit deeper into AI for assistance.
Sales|15|Avoidance Challenge|What did you discover today?
The biggest reason I don’t get to developing or maturing solutions is because I don’t have enough time to do it and focus on new sales. It is very helpful to frame a new concept as “what’s one real client problem I’ve seen that I could sketch a starting point for”.

How did these challenges change your perspective?
It did not change my perspective but confirmed it.

What will you do differently going forward?
It would be ideal if there was a role to develop solutions and mature the presales process. Until then, I will try to work smarter and streamline what I can, like the leads generation process with Strideshift.

Ask AI: "I've been avoiding [Developing Solutions]. Help me understand what I'm really avoiding - is it the task itself or something deeper?"

You're not just avoiding Developing Solutions — you're likely avoiding the invisible friction around it. Let’s break it down:
________________________________________
🔍 Step 1: Is it really the task… or something deeper?
If you say…	What you might actually be avoiding
“I don’t know where to start.” No	⚠️ Ambiguity / Overwhelm – the task isn’t defined clearly enough to trigger action.
“It’s not urgent yet.” No	⚠️ Fear of imperfection – you may be waiting to get it just right, or fearing judgment on early versions.
“It always takes longer than I expect.” Yes	⚠️ Mental energy cost – solution design requires deep focus, and you might be burned out or stretched thin.
“I don’t want to do it alone.” It would be ideal if it becomes a key focus point for Product Owners	⚠️ Isolation / Lack of feedback – you thrive on interaction, and solo problem-solving feels heavy or uninspiring.
“I keep getting distracted.”	⚠️ Lack of emotional reward – the work doesn’t provide fast feedback or external validation, so your brain looks for dopamine elsewhere. No, just difficult whilst chasing sales.
________________________________________
💡 Step 2: Based on your C-me profile…
You're:
•	Energetic, intuitive, and persuasive
•	Great at starting ideas, imagining possibilities
•	Most engaged when you're brainstorming, co-creating, or influencing others
•	Not wired for isolated, slow, or perfection-heavy tasks unless there's a spark or audience
So what you're likely avoiding is not the task itself — it’s that:
"Developing Solutions" as a solo, grindy, vague process doesn’t energize you.
You're not wired to sit alone with an undefined problem and silently build. You thrive when you're co-creating, pitching, or seeing real-time progress.
________________________________________
🔄 Reframe the task so it works for you:
•	💬 Co-create instead of solo-build: Book a 30-min brainstorm with someone to whiteboard with you. Record it. Yes, but it is mission critical that Product Owners also see this as a main focus area to develop new solutions in line with the sales requirements e.g. SAP integration and mobile solutions to complement SAP.
•	🧱 Chunk it into micro-wins: Define just the first brick today (e.g. one use case, sketch, or client pain point).
•	🪞 Make it visible + testable: Mock something and show it early to a client or team — get feedback fast.
•	🧠 Name the friction explicitly before starting: “This feels heavy because ____.” That awareness kills procrastination’s power.
________________________________________

Ask AI: Now walk me through starting this avoided task in a way that addresses what I'm actually resistant to, not just the surface task.

Let's walk through starting "Developing Solutions" — but in a way that directly tackles your under-the-surface resistance, not just the checklist version of the task.
You’re not resisting the idea of solving — you’re resisting:
•	Vague starting points
•	Solo grind work
•	Unclear ROI
•	Lack of feedback or energy from others
So we’ll rewire your approach to give you momentum, connection, and clarity — fast.
________________________________________
🛠️ 1. Name the Resistance (2 min)
Say out loud or write:
“I’m not avoiding the work — I’m avoiding the version of it that’s vague, isolating, and invisible. I do my best work when I’m creating, sharing, and seeing real-time progress.”
This immediately separates you from the resistance.
________________________________________
🎯 2. Define the First Tiny, Tangible Win (5 min)
Don’t “develop a solution.” That’s too big.
Instead, ask:
“What’s one real client problem I’ve seen that I could sketch a starting point for?”
•	Write a one-sentence description of that client pain
•	Sketch 2–3 bullet points of how your idea could begin to solve it
•	Done. You’ve started.
________________________________________
💬 3. Involve Someone (10–15 min)
You thrive on interaction, so create a feedback loop early.
•	Send a voice note or Loom to a peer/client:
“Hey, quick concept I’m playing with — does this resonate?”
•	Or book a 15-min feedback huddle with a team member or friendly client
•	Or post a rough mockup and ask for input
This removes isolation and gives you dopamine for progress.
________________________________________
🔧 4. Create a Time-Limited “Solution Sprint” (30 min max)
Set a 30-min timer. The only goal: make the idea slightly more real.
•	Sketch a Google Doc, Miro board, or slide
•	Use a template or framework to reduce effort (I can build you one)
•	You’re not delivering — just roughing in the shape
Then stop. The goal is movement, not mastery.
________________________________________
🪄 5. Close with Visibility & Reward (5 min)
Before you stop:
•	Share it with someone — even if rough
•	Or write down:
“I just moved this forward by doing ___, and now I know ___.”
This creates a feedback loop that builds confidence and reduces future resistance.
________________________________________
🚀 TL;DR: Resistance-Free Kickoff Plan
1.	Name the real resistance
2.	Define one specific client problem to solve
3.	Start with a sketch, not a full solution
4.	Involve another human quickly
5.	Cap it with a visible “win” or next step|2025-08-05

Day: 1 - Clarity Challenge
Role: Liberty
Date: 2025-07-02
Profundity Score: 49.0

I realized that I overcomplicate how I articulate something I am trying to explain or summarize. Using Copilot to explain it shifted my perspective in how it highlighted the key words relaying the meaning of my thought and combined this with simple conjunctions to ensure the sentence made sense and was clear for anyone to understand. The second half of the challenge showcased how the simple replacing of a selection of words changes the emotive meaning of the sentence, appealing to a people of more advanced linguistic aptitude but still ensured clarity. I intend on applying the same thinking Copilot introduced to my communications in future.
Liberty|1|Clarity Challenge|Hi Team,

I struggled a bit to put something together myself, so I decided to use a paragraph from a book I’m currently reading, Why Nations Fail by Daron Acemoglu, Moog Liu, and James A. Robinson. I hope that’s okay! Here’s the original excerpt:

“The course of institutional development that Japan charted in the nineteenth century again illustrates the interaction between critical junctures and small differences created by institutional drift. Japan, like China, was under absolutist rule. The Tokugawa family took over in 1600 and ruled over a feudal system that also banned international trade. Japan, too, faced a critical juncture created by Western intervention as four U.S. warships, commanded by Matthew C. Perry, entered Edo Bay in July 1853, demanding trade concessions similar to those England obtained from the Chinese in the Opium Wars. But this critical juncture played out very differently in Japan. Despite their proximity and frequent interactions, by the nineteenth century China and Japan had already drifted apart institutionally.”

Answers to questions:
1. In the 1800s, both Japan and China were pressured by powerful Western countries to allow trade and interaction with the outside world, but Japan responded quite differently because its government and institutions had gradually developed in separate ways over time.

2. In the 1800s, both Japan and China were pressured by powerful Western countries to allow trade and interaction with the outside world, but Japan responded quite differently because its government and institutions had gradually developed in separate ways over time.

What surprised me most was realising how something that felt clear in my head didn't come across the same way when I tried to explain it. AI made me realise the difference in word choice, like how much of a difference small wording makes.|2025-07-02

thst the one on one should be more about them - given a shorter time I will also make the meeting more concise
Britehouse Mobility|15|Avoidance Challenge|Fear of Making Mistakes
You might be worried about setting it up incorrectly, which could lead to errors, compliance issues, or complications later.
This fear of "messing up" can cause procrastination.
2. Overwhelm or Perfectionism
The task may seem technically complex or time-consuming, making you feel overwhelmed.
You might also fear that it won’t be “perfect,” leading to avoidance until you feel fully ready.
3. Lack of Clarity or Confidence
If you’re unsure about what exactly needs to be done or the specific steps, it can create mental blocks.
Not feeling confident in your knowledge about the setup process can lead to hesitation.
4. Resistance to Change or New Processes
If setting up on Xero is a new process, you might be resisting change or feeling uncomfortable with new technology.
Sometimes, avoiding is a way to stay within familiar routines.
5. Underlying Anxiety About the Business or Financial Details
Money and financial systems can feel intimidating or stressful, especially if you’re worried about errors affecting your business or finances.
Sometimes, avoidance is a way to sidestep those anxieties.
What’s really happening?
Most likely, you’re avoiding the setup because it touches on fears of making mistakes, feeling overwhelmed, or dealing with uncertainty. These deeper feelings can create resistance that makes the task seem more daunting than it actually is.

How to address it:
Break the setup into small, manageable steps.
Seek guidance or tutorials that clarify exactly what to do.
Reframe the task as a learning opportunity, not a critical mistake.
Remember that you can fix or adjust things later—perfection isn’t required upfront.
Consider delegating or asking for help if it’s a confidence issue.
In essence: The avoidance is probably less about the task itself and more about underlying fears or uncertainties. Addressing those feelings directly can make the task feel more approachable.
Step 1: Reframe the mindset
Shift your perspective: View this as a learning process, not a final judgment of your abilities. Remind yourself, "It’s okay to make mistakes; I can fix them later."
Set a low-stakes goal: Focus on just getting started rather than completing everything perfectly.
Step 2: Break it into tiny, manageable steps
Identify the smallest possible action you can take right now. For example:

Opening Xero and logging in.
Finding the “Create New Company” button.
Entering basic info (company name, country).
Your resistance here: The feeling that the whole setup is overwhelming.
Solution: Just do one tiny step without pressure—like logging in or setting up the basic profile.

Step 3: Gather reassurance and resources
Find a quick tutorial or checklist that walks through the exact steps.
Remind yourself: “I can follow simple instructions,” and that you can refer back if needed.
If possible, ask someone experienced for a quick walkthrough or support.
Step 4: Set a timer and commit to just 5 minutes
Challenge: Tell yourself, “I will work on this for just 5 minutes.”
During these 5 minutes:
Open Xero.
Follow the step-by-step guide.
Don’t aim for perfection—just get the basics done.
Your resistance here: Fear of wasting time or doing it wrong.
Solution: Commit to a small, manageable window—this reduces the pressure and makes starting easier.

Step 5: Accept and normalize imperfection
Remind yourself: “It’s okay if I make mistakes. I can correct them later.”
Focus on progress, not perfection.
Step 6: Celebrate small wins
After your 5-minute session, acknowledge what you’ve accomplished.
Even just logging in or entering basic info is progress!
Step 7: Decide next steps based on how you feel
If you feel ready, continue with the next small step.
If you need a break, give yourself permission to pause, knowing you’ve made progress and can return with a fresh mindset.
Summary:
Start by reducing the task to a tiny, low-pressure action—something you can do in a few minutes. Focus on accepting mistakes and reframing the setup as a learning process. Celebrate each small victory to build confidence and reduce resistance.

By approaching it this way, you’re directly addressing the feelings of overwhelm, fear, or perfectionism that keep you stuck.|2025-09-10
